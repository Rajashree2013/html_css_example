                    A feature article is a persuasive text that expresses an opinion, informs the reader about a subject and is enjoyable to read. 
                    Feature articles differ from many other kinds of news articles because they share a general perspective on a subject, 
                    instead of reporting news about a particular situation.
                     This makes feature articles last for longer, as theyâ€™re less likely to lose relevance as time passes.
